Some tools for serializing objects in Unity

Some tools for saving (serializable) objects in Unity using either Unity's JsonUtility or .Net XML-Serialization and saving/loading them 
from PlayerPrefs or Resources. Also includes a tool for generating a ScriptableObject-derived template for a class that can then save instances
of the class to a xml or json file in the editor (to be used as defaults for example).
