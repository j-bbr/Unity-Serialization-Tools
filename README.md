Some tools for serializing objects in Unity

Tools for saving (serializable) objects in Unity using either Unity's JsonUtility or .Net XML-Serialization and saving/loading them from PlayerPrefs or Resources. Also includes a tool for generating a ScriptableObject-derived template for a class that can then save instances of the class to a xml or json file in the editor (to be used as defaults for example). Last but not at least a script that saves/loads textures from PlayerPrefs as a base64-encoded string.
